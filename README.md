# [Trellista](http://trellista.pagodabox.com)
 
View [Trello](http://trello.com) boards as a simple html list. Optionally save to disk so that you can re-open in your favorite editor, or MS-Word if you have to :)

## Overview

Source code for the [Trellista](http://trellista.pagodabox.com) web page. This example exports only the most basic data. Review the [Trello API](https://trello.com/docs/) docs for more information.

## Usage
 
To use the live site, head over to http://trellista.pagodabox.com and connect to Trello. View and export your boards.
 
## Installation

Of course you don't trust another site to connect to your Trello account! To view your boards just clone the repo and load index.html.

A php enabled web server is required if you want to save the lists as html. (or re-create save.php file for your preferred server-side language)
